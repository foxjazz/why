The Idea of this app is to let users evaluate item price data in Eve.
First pick a couple of Regions to monitor.
Second pick some items. It is best to keep items at a minimum because monitoring will happen once ever 10 seconds to minmize load. 
So for instance if there are 2 regions, and 2 items, the turn around will be a total of 50 seconds (4 * 10 + 10)
Likewise if there are 2 regions and 6 items, the monitoring of each item will be 12 * 10 + 10 (130 seconds)
So it is best to keep your watch list small.

The Price board is there for users to view price data for each item currently listed. Sell orders are only monitored.
